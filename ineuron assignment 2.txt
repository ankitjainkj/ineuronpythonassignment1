       We can write it as True , False

Ans :-                    AND Truth table
          
           x                y         Output
          1                 1           1

Q) 4  What are the values of following expression?
          (5>4) and (3==5)                                                        False
          not 5>4                                                                          False
          (5>4) or (3==5)                                                            True
          not((5>4 or 3 ==5))                                                    False
          (True and True) and (True== False)                     False               
          (not False) or (not True)                                           True

Q 5) What are the six comparision operator?
Ans :-  1) Less than (<)
              2) Greater than(>)
               3) Less than or equal to(<=)
               4) Greater than or equal to (>=)
               5) Equal to(==)
               6) Not equal to (=!)

Q 6) How do you tell the diffence between equal to and assignment operator? Describe the condition and when will you use them?
  Ans:- (=) Assignment operator is use to assign the value to the variable.
             (==) Equal to operator is use to check the condition whether two operands are equal or not.
         eg:- Suppose we have variable a and if we want to assign the value 30 in variable a then we will use assignment operator like a= 30
                   Suppose we have two variable a and b and if we want to check wheter a and b are qual or not then we will use like a== b

Q 7) Idetify the three blocks in code?
   spam = 0
if spam == 10:
print('eggs)
if spam>5:
print('bacon')
else:
print('ham')
print('spam')
print('spam')
  
Ans:- The three blocks are everything inside the if statement and the lines print('bacon') and print('ham').
print('eggs')
if spam > 5:
print('bacon')
else:
print('ham')
print('spam')



Q8) Write a code that prints Hello if 1 is store in spam, prints Howdy if 2 is store in spam, prints Greetings! if anything else is store in spam.
Ans:-  spam= int(input("Enter a number))
            if spam == 1:
            print("Hello")
            elif spam ==2:
            print("Howdy)
            else:
            print("Greeting!)

Q9 ).If your programme is stuck in an endless loop, what keys youâ€™ll press?
Ans:-  CTRL+C

 Q10). How can you tell the difference between break and continue?
Ans:- Break statement is use to terminate the entire loop and passes the control to the next statement.
          Continue is use when we dont want to run the certain condition and we dont want to terminate the loop then we will use continue statement.


 Q11). In a for loop, what is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1)?
Ans:- Range funtion return the sequence the number. In the for loop output of all the above three statement will be same. range(10) will print number 0 to 9. In the statement range(0,10) mention the start point and stop point but 10 will be excluded that means it will print 0 to 9. and in statement three range(0,10,1) mention the start point , stop point and step size. so it will print 0 to 9, 10 will be excluded.


 Q12. Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop. Then write an equivalent
program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop.

Ans:- Using for loop
 for i in range (1,11):
           print(i)

Using while loop
i = 1
while(i<=10):
    print(i)
    i += 1


13. If you had a function named bacon() inside a module named spam, how would you call it after
importing spam?
  Ans :- spam.bacon()
