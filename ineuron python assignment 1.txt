Q1) 1. In the below elements which of them are values or an expression? eg:- values can be
integer or string and expressions will be mathematical operators.

*                                                  Expression
'hello'                                         Value
-87.8                                           Value
-                                                    Expression
/                                                     Expression
+                                                   Expression 
6                                                   Value


2. What is the difference between string and variable?
Ans:- Variable is use to store the data or we can say that variable is a the name that given to particular memory location. whereas the string is a type of
        variable that use to store a character or we can say that anything and everything which is enclosed within single or  double quotes is a string.
         Variable can hold string but string can't hold variable.


3. Describe three different data types.
Ans:- 1) Numeric Data type:- In python numeric data type is a data type which represent number.  We can classified numeric data type in 3 part. 1) Integer 
                                                       2)float 3) Complex Number 
           2) Sequencial data type:- Sequencial data type is a ordered collection of data. that means they follow some sequence. there are some order in
                                                               sequencial  data type. it allows us to store the multiple values in orderd manners .There are three types of sequencial data                                                              type. 1) String 2) List 3) Tuple 
           3) Sets  data type:-    Sets is a unordered collection of data. Sets a mutable and every set must have  unique elements.

4.  What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions do?
Ans:-  An expresison is a combination of  values , operators and operands. If we write the expression python interpreter will evaluate it and will display the results.


5. This assignment statements, like spam = 10. What is the difference between an
expression and a statement?
 Ans:-  Here the statement means command that we are giving to python interpreter that assign the 10 in the variable spam. and expression means assigment operation = 


6) After running the following code, what does the variable bacon contain?
bacon = 22
bacon + 1
Ans:- 23

7.) What should the values of the following two terms be?
Ans:- 
1)  'spam' + 'spamspam'   
     spamspamspam

2) spam*3 
    spamspamspam


8. Why is eggs a valid variable name while 100 is invalid? 
Ans:-  100 can't be variable name because 100 is a number and variable name can't start with number.


9. What three functions can be used to get the integer, floating-point number, or string
version of a value?
Ans:-    For integer :-                                     int
              For floating- point number  :-     float
             For String :-                                         str


10. Why does this expression cause an error? How can you fix it?
 'i have eaten ' + 99 + 'burritos'
Ans:- This expression will  cause an error because  we can't concatenate string with different data type. Only the concatenation of string with string                         is possible and here 99 is an integer number. 
         we can fix it by convert 99 into string
       ' i have eaten' + str(99) + 'burritos'
